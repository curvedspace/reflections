Using diff made it easier to spot a bug because it shows up what has changed from
one version to the other.  Isolating only the changes means you can analyze huge files 
easily.

By having the entire history of a file you can see how it evolved other time in terms
of design and also function.

Manual commits are better because this gives the developer control over the intent of
the commit. Auto-saving the text locally can be used as well since this does not need
to compile like a commit should.

Since git is meant for source code, it tracks changes across files in one swoop.  Google
docs is meant to track one file at a time so it does not do this.

Using the log and diff commands in git will allow you to review changes you made and 
also see what changed from one release to the next (or others).

Using version control gives you confidence in making changes because you can always
revert back to an older state if things go wrong.

After setting up my git workspace, I would like to create a repository and check in some
files to practice.
