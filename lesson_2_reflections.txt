When you initialize a repository it sets up the internal database it uses to keep
track of the files in the repository.  It needs to do this so it can manage the new
files and their changes later on.

The staging area is a place where you can drop changes before commiting then and hence 
adding them to the actual repo.  It gives you flexibility to group changes into a logical
group.
